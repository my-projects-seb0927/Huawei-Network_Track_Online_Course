# Lab Guide - Computers Network Course

**How to search information about the network devices**
 1. Go to <support.huawei.com>
 2. Click on the **Enterprise** button
 3. You can look for the device you are looking information for below where it says **"Enterprise Network"**.
 4. Once you have entered to a device, select the model of the device you are looking for
 5. Scroll down and you will see a tab called **"Documentation"**, click on it and from there you can search for the product documentation.
 6. Opening the *hdx* shows the documentation of the product. You can look the product where it says *"Chasis"* or the configuration on *"Configuration" > "CLI-based Configuration"*.
 
> ðŸ’¡ The software where the labs are done is called "eNSP".
 
## Basic Operation of Huawei 
 > ðŸ’¡  This lab configures Huawei devices to learn about and get familiar with the basic operations of Huawei VRP
 
### Topology
[Imagen]
 
In order to finish this lab, follow the next steps:
### Step 1: Start the device
 1. Drag a *"Router"* to the board
 2. Start the device: Right-click on the Router > Start device.
 
### Step 2: View Basic Device Information
 1. In order to access to the CLI of the router: Right-click on the Router > CLI. This is where all configuration is done.
 2. In order to see the device version information:
	 ```
	 <Huawei>display version
	 ```

### Step 3: Complete basic device configuration	
 
 1. Change the name of the router, entering to the **System view** to *"R1"*:
	```
	<Huawei>system-view
	[Huawei]sysname R1
	```
 2. Enter to the **Interface view **(Where we modify the ports of the router) and add an IP address:
	```
	[R1]interface g
	[R1]interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0]
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0] ip address 192.168.1.1 24
	```
	If you need to exit from an interface, type `quit` or `q` to a lower-level view.
 3. To get help from the system to remember a command:
	```
	[R1]i?
	icmp
	igmp-snooping
	info-center
	ip
	ipv6
	[...]
	```
 4. To get help from the system to remember all the options from a command:
	```
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0] ip ?
	address    Address
	apply      Apply security policy
	binding    Enable binding of an interface with a VPN instance
	[...]
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0] ip address ?
	X.X.X.X     IP address
	bootp-alloc IP address allocated by BOOTP
	[...]
	```
5. Let's just set an IP address manually:
	```
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0] ip address 10.0.0.1 24
	```
9. If you need to display the running configuration in the current view, insert:
	```
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0] display this
	[...]
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0] display current-configuration
	[...]
	``` 
	Let's remember that the devices support incomplete keyword input, for example, `dis cu` is equivalent `display current-configuration`. Finally, with *tab* you can auto-complete the commands if it's possible.
6. Now we need to delete the IP address configuration of GigabitEthernet 0/0/0. This can be possible using the undo command:
	```
	[R1]interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0
	[R1-GigabitEthernet0/0/0] undo ip address
	```
	And if you display the information again with `display this`, it will be empty.

### Step 4: Save the current device configuration
1. In order to save the current device configuration:
	```
	<R1>save
	```
	> ðŸ’¡ The save command saves the configuration to the default path and overwrite the original configuration file. 
	You can also run it to save the current configuration to a specified file on the storage device.
2. You can also compare the current configuration with the configuration used for the next startup:
	```
	<R1> compare configuration
	```

### Step 5: Operating the File System of the Device
1. You can display the file list in the current directory:
	```
	<R1> dir
	```
	> ðŸ’¡ **vrpcfg.zip:** Configuration file. Must be *.cgf* or *.zip* extension.
	**ar651c-v300r019c00Sspc100.cc:** System software. Must be a.cc extension.
2. Let's now save the current configuration but in another file:
	```
	<R1>save test.cfg
	```
	If you use the `dir` command again, you will see the *test.cfg* file there.
3. Now with that file, you can set it to the configuration file used for the next startup
	```
	<R1>startup saved-configuration test.cfg
	```
4. And if you need to display the file used for the next startup:
	```
	<R1>display startup
	```
	> ðŸ’¡ This commands displays the system software, backup system software, configuration file, license file, patch file, and voice file related to the current and next startup of the device.
5. Finally, let's clear the configuration file:
	```
	<R1>reset saved-configuration
	```
### Step 6: Restart the device
1. Let's restart the device:
	```
	<R1>reboot
	```

### Questions and Additional Contents
- Â¿In step 5, the reset saved-configuration command is used to clear the configuration. Why is the configuration still retained after the switch is restarted?
	**Answer:** Because we set up the configuration file for the next startup in the same step.
