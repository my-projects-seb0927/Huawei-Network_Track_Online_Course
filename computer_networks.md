## Basics of Computer Network

**What is a computer network**
A computer network connects multiple computers through communication links to share resource and deliver information.

A computer network is a complex system that involves comprehensive technologies

**What is a protocol**
In order to achieve interconnection and interoperation, different system entities on the computer network must comply with mutually acceptable rules during communication. A set of these rules is called a **communication procedure** or **protocol**.

Protocols must be formulated or agreed upon in advance so that the communication parties can understand the meaning of each other's information

**Classification of computer networks**
This is how computer networks are classified:
- **Based on the Networking Sharing Service Mode:**
	- *Client/Server* (C/S) network
	- *Peer to Peer* (P2P) network
	- *Browser/Server* (B/S) network
	- *Hybrid Networks*
- **Based on Network Nodes' Distribution Ranges**
	- *Local area network (LAN)*: A computer network that spans a distance of no more than 10 km.
	- *Metropolitan area network (MAN)*: It typically spans a distance of 10 km to 100 km.
	- *Wide area network (WAN)*: It spans a distance of more than 1000 km. It's usually has interconnected LANs or MANs

The reason because computer networks are divided in different layers is because it is easier to understand, letting some advantages as:
- Facilitate layer-by-layer system analysis and resolver overarching problems
- Developing layer-specific standards makes it easier to understand and revise such standards.
- After layering, the system is easier to modify and maintain.
- Etc.

**What is the OSI Model**
The OSI model was created to establish an open Internet standard. This model divides the network structure into seven layers:
- *The application layer:* Provides interfaces between network services and end users
- *The presentation layer:* Provides functions such as data presentation, encryption/decryption, and compression/decompression.
- *The session layer:* Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
- *The transport layer:* Defines the protocol, port number for data transmission and provides functions of flow control and error detection.
- *The network layer:* Performs local addressing and implements route selection between different networks.
- *The data link layer:* Provides functions such as establishing logical connections, hardware addressing, and error connection.
- *The physical layer:* Establishes, maintains, and disconnects physical connections

The first three ones are grouped into the **Application Layer** and then we hace the *Five-layer Internet Reference Model*.

** What is Data Transition**
Data sending is achieved through a typical application data encapsulation process:
1. The user data is encapsulated with the application layer header through the application layer protocol, resulting in the application data.
2. The application data is encapsulated with a TCP header at the transport layer resulting in a packet **(Data segment)**.
3. The packet is transmitted to the network layer and encapsulated with an IP header **(Data Packet(**.
4. The encapsulated IP packet is transmitted to the data link layer which encapsulates it with a MAC header resulting in a **Data Frame** 
5. The Data Frame is transmitted to the Ethernet card **(Data transmission process)**

**How does Data Reception works**
It receives data unpacking data layer by layer starting from the Ethernet card. It's the process from above but in reverse.

## Core Protocols
**Computer network protocols**
In a computer network, various specifications or protocols must be used to ensure secure, stable, and efficient running of the network. These protocols include the following types:

- **Network node identification protocol**: It is used to identify network nodes. Some examples are MAC, IPv4, IPv6 and RFID.
- **Network data transmission protocol**: It is used to ensure that network node data reaches the target node correctly. It includes HDLC, TCP, and UDP.
- **Network link contention protocol**: It is used to ensure that each network node has an opportunity to transmit data using a network link. It includes CSMA and Token.
- **Network resource sharing protocol**: It is used to ensure that different organizations and individuals can share information. It includes HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

**Network node identity protocol**
- A **LAN** uses a network hardware address or a MAC address to uniquely identify each network node.
- A **WAN** that is formed by multiple interconnected LANs use a logical address, or an IP address to uniquely identify each network node

**MAC address**
To ensure that each node in a LAN can be uniquely identified, the IEEE stipulates that each node must have a unique network label. That's the MAC address
> ðŸ’¡ It is also called the LAN address, physical address, etc.

It is used to identify the identity or location of a network node. It's written into the hardware by a network device manufacturer during production. A MAC address is inside a NIC.

- A MAC address consists of 48 bits. 6 bytes that are each separated by "." or "-". *EX: 08-00-20-0A-8c-6D*
- A MAC address cannot be replaced (*Theoretically*) unless you replace the network adapter.
- The LAN uses MAC addresses to identify specific users.

**IP Address**
In order to shield the differences between LANs, and in order to implement interconnection and interworking between different physical networks. IP address is an addressing method for allocating a unique address to each host on each subnet on the Internet.

- An IP address consists of 32-bit binary number, which is usually divided into four bytes. *EX: 192.168.85.17*

They are classified into five types:
- **Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D and Class E**
- **Class D** are used for multicast
- **Class E** are reserved for future use
- Only the three first IP addresses can be allocated
- **Class A:** They are used in large-scale regional networks. It supports a maximum of 2^24 hosts
- **Class B:** They are used for large-scale organizations and companies. It supports a maximum of 65534 hosts.
- **Class C:**  They are used for small organizations and  companies. It supports a maximum of 254 hosts.

> **There are some rules for IP addresses by the Network Information Center**
> - An IP address with all 32 bits is set to 1 is a broadcast address..
> - An IP address with all 32 bits set to 0 is the network itself.
> - The eight most significant bits are 01111111 indicating the loopback address, which is used for network software test and communication between local processes. The most common one is (127.0.0.1)
